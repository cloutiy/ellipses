# Typesetting Markup Language

Lightweight Markup languages like Markdown help to increase productivity and insulate users of the technical complexity of their target platforms.

Although Markdown offers a simple way of handling structural elements of a document (headings, blockquotes, lists etc..), it does not provide a way to address stylistic elements of a document.

TML fills this gap by providing a simple markup to define various stylistic featutes of a document to allow for greater manipulation of elements such as font manipulation (font family, size, color) as well as typographical features (word spacing, pair kerning, vertical and horizontal positioning on a page, margins, indentation, text justification and text flow).

TML addresses the needs of typographers, authors, writers that need a little more control over the visual elements of text offered by more complex systems asich as TeX and Groff, in a way that insulates the user from having to know TeX or Groff, yet still benefit from their powerful features and beautiful output. 

Heavily inspired by Peter Schaffter's tremendous work and uses his [MOM macros](www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html) for groff.
