# Ellipses Typesetting Language

Ellipses is a typesetting language that is meant to be an alternative to TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt.  It achieves this by combining simple markup for structural elements of the text and uses simple syntax for providing stylistic elements and precision typesetting to documents.

Largely based on Peter Schaffter's tremendous work and uses his [MOM macros](www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html) for groff.
